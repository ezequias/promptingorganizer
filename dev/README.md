## File Structure :card_file_box:

```
├── index.html      → Main page
├── style.css       → All styling (Material-inspired + custom fixes)
├── script.js       → Core logic (categories, prompts, import/export)
├── logo-new.png    → Header logo (feel free to replace)
└── favicon.ico     → Favicon
```

## How to Use :technologist:

1. **Open** `index.html` in your browser (double-click the file or drag it into Chrome/Firefox/Edge).
2. **Add a category** → type name → “Add Category”
3. **Select a category** → it becomes active (highlighted)
4. **Write your prompt** in the big textarea → choose category → “Add Prompt”
5. **Use the buttons** on each prompt card:
   - Copy icon → copies the full prompt text to clipboard
   - Trash icon → deletes the prompt
6. **Manage categories**:
   - Double-click a category name to rename it
   - Click the trash icon next to a category to delete it (deletes all prompts inside)
7. **Backup / Transfer**:
   - Click **Download** → saves a timestamped `.json` file with everything
   - Click **Upload** → select a previously downloaded file → confirms overwrite → restores everything

## Customization :man_artist:

- Change colors by editing the `:root` variables at the top of `style.css`
- Replace `logo-new.png` with your own logo (keep same filename or update the `<img src>` path)
- Change default categories by editing the initial array in `script.js`:

```js
let categories = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('promptCategories')) || ['General', 'Creative', 'Technical'];
```

## Privacy & Security :locked_with_key:

- 100% client-side – nothing is ever sent to any server
- Data lives only in your browser’s `localStorage` and in the JSON files you export
- You control everything

## Browser Support :motor_boat:
